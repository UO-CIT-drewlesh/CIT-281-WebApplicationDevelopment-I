# Project 5 – Monster Game Simulation with Classes and Async

This project implements a simple game simulation using JavaScript classes and asynchronous programming. It models a game where monsters with varying life values face periodic life drains until they are all defeated.

### Skills Developed
- Designing and implementing JavaScript classes with constructors and methods  
- Using object destructuring in class constructors for flexibility  
- Managing state and properties for multiple class instances (monsters)  
- Implementing asynchronous behavior with `async`/`await` and promises to create timed game loops  
- Applying array methods like `.map()` and `.forEach()` for data transformation and iteration  
- Utilizing modular code with separate files for classes and main game logic  
- Debugging and console output for game state tracking  

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js runtime environment (for execution)

### Reflection
This project strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, particularly how classes can model complex entities like game characters. Implementing asynchronous delays mimicked real-time game mechanics, enhancing my grasp of JavaScript’s event loop and promise-based timing. The modular design helped keep the code organized and maintainable, which is critical in larger applications.
