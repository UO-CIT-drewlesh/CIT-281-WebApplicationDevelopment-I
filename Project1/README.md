# Web Application Development I

## Project 1 â€“ Basic JavaScript Functions

This project includes foundational JavaScript exercises aimed at strengthening my understanding of core concepts like arrays, functions, and randomization.

### Skills Developed
- Working with arrays and accessing elements by index  
- Using built-in JavaScript objects like `Date` to retrieve dynamic data  
- Writing functions to generate random integers within a range  
- Looping constructs to build random strings character-by-character  
- Using `console.log()` for debugging and output

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)
