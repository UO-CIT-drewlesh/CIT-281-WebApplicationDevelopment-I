# Project 6

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to practice using JavaScript classes, inheritance, and method overriding to calculate the perimeter and area of different geometric shapes. The program defines a base `Shape` class, and two derived classes `Rectangle` and `Triangle`, each with their own specific implementation for calculating area. The code also demonstrates using arrays, loops, and `switch` statements to handle multiple shapes and output results.

## Skills Learned
- Creating and using JavaScript classes
- Implementing class inheritance
- Overriding methods in derived classes
- Using `reduce()` to calculate totals
- Applying mathematical formulas (e.g., Heronâ€™s formula for triangle area)
- Iterating through arrays of data
- Using `switch` statements for decision making
- Outputting results to the console

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
